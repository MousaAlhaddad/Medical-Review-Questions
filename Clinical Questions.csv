Most cryptorchid testes are undescended, but some are absent (due to agenesis or atrophy).",Urology,,,
2018-06-09 00:00:00,What is cryptorchidism?,Cryptorchidism by definition suggests a hidden testis: a testis that is not within the scrotum and does not descend spontaneously into the scrotum by four months of age (or corrected age for premature infants).,Urology,,,
2018-06-09 00:00:00,What are the usual locations for undescended testes? ,"True undescended testes have stopped short along their normal path of descent into the scrotum. They may remain in the abdominal cavity or they may be palpable in the inguinal canal (intracanalicular) or just outside the external ring (suprascrotal).

Approximately 10 percent of cases of cryptorchidism are bilateral.
Among the unilateral nonpalpable cases, there is a left-sided predominance.
The most common location for an undescended testis is just outside the external ring (suprascrotal), followed by the inguinal canal (intracanalicular), and finally the abdomen. ",Urology,,,
2018-06-09 00:00:00,What is the definition of retractile testes?,"Retractile testes are normal testes that have been pulled into a suprascrotal position by the cremasteric reflex. These testes can be brought into a dependent scrotal position and will remain there if the cremasteric reflex is overcome (eg, by holding the testis in the scrotum for at least one minute).",Urology,,,
2018-06-09 00:00:00,What is the definition of ascending testes?,"Ascending testes are noted to be in a scrotal position in early childhood and then to ""ascend"" and become undescended (i.e., acquired undescended testes).",Urology,,,
2018-06-09 00:00:00,What is the definition of ectopic testes?,"Ectopic testes descend normally through the external ring but then are diverted to an aberrant position. They may be palpable in the superficial inguinal pouch (most common), suprapubic region, femoral canal, perineum, or contralateral scrotal compartment (least common).",Urology,,,
2018-06-09 00:00:00,What is the prognosis of undescended testes? ,"Most (approximately 70 percent) congenitally undescended testes descend spontaneously.

Most testicles that are undescended at birth complete their descent within the first six months of life. If they haven't descended by six months of age, they are unlikely to descend and generally require surgical manipulation into and attachment to the scrotum (orchiopexy, orchidopexy).

Men with a history of undescended testes have an increased incidence of lower sperm counts, sperm of poorer quality, and lower fertility rates than men with normally descended testes.",Urology,,,
2018-06-09 00:00:00,What are the causes of absent testes? ,"Absent testes can result from agenesis or, much more commonly, intrauterine vascular compromise (eg, prenatal testicular torsion).",Urology,,,

2018-06-09 00:00:00,What are the complications of undescended and ectopic testes? ,"Potential complications and sequelae of true undescended testes (but not retractile or absent testes) include inguinal hernia, testicular torsion, testicular trauma (for intracanalicular testis—from compression against the pubic bone), subfertility, and malignant transformation. 

Potential complications of ectopic testes include blunt trauma from compression against the pubic bone and decreased spermatogenesis. However, ectopic testes are not thought to be associated with malignant transformation.",Urology,,,
2018-06-09 00:00:00,When should refer patients with undescended or ascending testes? ,"Congenital palpable or nonpalpable undescended testes (unilateral or bilateral); referral between 6 and 12 months of age is recommended.

2018-08-12 00:00:00,What is the mechanism of anaphylaxis? ,"The mechanism responsible for most cases of human anaphylaxis involves immunoglobulin E (IgE). However, anaphylaxis can be also nonimmunologic.
In IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, the activation of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils results in the release of preformed inflammatory mediators, including histamine, tryptase, chymase, heparin, histamine-releasing factor, and platelet-activating factor. Cellular activation also stimulates the production of lipid-derived mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What are the causes of death in anaphylaxis? ,"In humans, the predominant shock organs are the heart, lung, and vasculature, and fatalities are divided between circulatory collapse and respiratory arrest. 

Most fatal food-induced reactions involve difficulty breathing and culminate in respiratory arrest. In contrast, venom- or medication-induced anaphylaxis more often cause shock and cardiovascular collapse.",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What is biphasic anaphylaxis? ,"Biphasic anaphylaxis is defined as a recurrence of symptoms that develop following the apparent resolution of the initial anaphylactic event without additional exposure to the trigger. Biphasic anaphylaxis occurs in up to one-fifth of anaphylaxis cases, and the mechanisms underlying the recurrence of symptoms are unclear. 
It typically occurs within 12 hours after resolution of the initial symptoms, although recurrences up to 72 hours later have been reported.",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,List some examples of underdiagnosed fatal anaphylaxis. ,"1. Asthmatic patients (especially children and adolescents) with concomitant food allergy may suffer food-induced anaphylaxis with prominent respiratory symptoms and be misdiagnosed as having a fatal asthma attack. It is therefore important to remind all patients with food allergy and asthma to think about what food they might have eaten when they have the abrupt onset of asthma without a clear trigger. This may be especially important when the asthma episode does not respond to the individual's usual treatment in the usual manner.
2. Older adults with chronic pulmonary disease may die at home from antibiotic-induced anaphylaxis and be misdiagnosed as a cardiac or respiratory arrest due to either the chronic condition or the recent infection.
3. Unrecognized insect stings may cause collapse and sudden death and be misdiagnosed as cardiovascular events, particularly if anaphylaxis involved myocardial ischemia or an arrhythmia. The cardiovascular aspects of anaphylaxis are reviewed separately. ",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What are the most common causes of food-induced fatal anaphylaxis?,Peanuts and tree nuts account for the majority of food-induced fatalities. Cow's milk and seafood are also leading causes of severe and fatal reactions,Immunology,,,

2018-08-12 00:00:00,What are the three leading causes of anaphylaxis?,"The most common causes of fatal anaphylaxis are foods, medications, and insect stings. Other reported causes of fatal anaphylaxis include latex and rupture of a hydatid cyst.",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What are the risk factors for fatal anaphylaxis? ,"The most consistently noted risk factor for fatal anaphylaxis is concomitant asthma. Other possible risk factors include delayed or no administration of epinephrine, upright posture, and other cardiopulmonary diseases. 
Patients with systemic mastocytosis may be at higher risk for fatal anaphylaxis, even in the absence of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy.  ",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What is the recommended posture during anaphylaxis?,"Maintaining the patient in an upright position after collapse can lead to pulseless electrical activity and cardiac arrest (empty ventricle syndrome). 
Patients, caregivers, clinicians, and ""first responders"" must understand the importance of placing the patient in the supine position with legs elevated if signs of hypotension are present during an allergic reaction.",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What is the criterion for anaphylaxis? ,"Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) involving the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) and at least one of the following:
1. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze/bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia)
2. Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms and signs of end-organ malperfusion (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)

Lower your diagnostic threshold if the patient has a history of a near-fatal anaphylaxis or if he exposed to a known allergen (reduced BP after exposure is enough to establish the diagnosis).",Immunology,,,

Ethanol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opiates can exacerbate anaphylaxis symptoms by causing nonimmunologic mast cell activation.",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What are the diagnostic tests for anaphylaxis? ,"The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based on clinical criteria. The results of measurements of tryptase and other mediators are not available immediately at the point of care. However, detection of elevated total tryptase (in serum or plasma) or histamine (in plasma) can be helpful in excluding other disorders that do not involve activation of mast cells and basophils. Of note, elevations in these mediators are transient and are not detected in many patients. ",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What are the median times to cardiac arrest in fatal anaphylaxis?," In fatal anaphylaxis, median times to cardiorespiratory arrest are 5 minutes in iatrogenic anaphylaxis, 15 minutes in stinging insect venom-induced anaphylaxis, and 30 minutes in food-induced anaphylaxis. ",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What is FDEIAn? ,"A variant of food-induced anaphylaxis is food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIAn), which refers to an IgE-mediated, food-induced anaphylactic reaction that develops only when exercise is undertaken within a few hours of ingesting a food. If the food is consumed without subsequent exercise or if exercise is performed without associated ingestion of the food, the patient does not develop allergic. symptoms",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What is the  relation between past history of anaphylaxis and its severity?,"A history of previous food-induced anaphylaxis of any severity is a risk for anaphylaxis. However, the severity of previous reactions does not predict the severity of future reactions. ",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What are the cornerstones of initial management of anaphylaxis? ,"The cornerstones of initial management are the following:
1. Removal of the inciting cause, if possible (eg, stop infusion of a suspect medication).

2. Call for help 

3. Intramuscular (IM) injection of epinephrine at the earliest opportunity, followed by additional epinephrine by IM or intravenous (IV) injection.

4. Placement of the patient in the supine position with the lower extremities elevated, unless there is prominent upper airway swelling prompting the patient to remain upright (and often leaning forward). If the patient is vomiting, placement of the patient semi recumbent with lower extremities elevated may be preferable. Place pregnant patients on their left side.

5. Supplemental oxygen.

6. Volume resuscitation with IV fluids.",Immunology,,,
2018-08-12 00:00:00,What is the dose of Epinephrine in anaphylaxis? ,"In anaphylaxis, give epinephrine 0.3 to 0.5 mg intramuscularly, preferably in the mid-outer thigh. Can repeat every 5 to 15 minutes (or more frequently), as needed. If epinephrine is injected promptly IM, most patients respond to one, two, or at most, three doses.

2018-08-17 00:00:00,What is the role of antibiotics in managing cellulitis and abscess?,"Patients with cellulitis should be managed with antibiotic therapy. Patients with abscess should undergo incision and drainage, and debrided material should be sent for culture and susceptibility testing.

The role of antibiotic therapy for patients with abscess depends on individual clinical circumstances. Patients with multiple lesions or single abscess ≥2 cm, extensive surrounding cellulitis, associated comorbidities or immunosuppression, signs of systemic infection, or inadequate clinical response to incision and drainage alone should be managed with antimicrobial therapy (in addition to incision and drainage). Management with incision and drainage alone (in the absence of antimicrobial therapy) is generally sufficient for otherwise healthy patients with skin abscess <2 cm in the absence of the above factors.",Infectious Diseases,,,

2018-08-17 00:00:00,What are the oral antibiotic options for skin and soft tissues infections caused by MRSA? ," Patients with mild infection (localized involvement with no systemic symptoms) due to known or suspected MRSA may be treated with oral antibiotic therapy. Oral antibiotic agents of choice include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), tetracyclines (such as doxycycline or minocycline), or clindamycin. 

In the setting of empiric antibiotic therapy, the efficacy of the above agents against the potential pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) should be considered. Clindamycin and TMP-SMX are active against GAS; doxycycline has uncertain activity. 

Alternative oral agents include oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid) and the fluoroquinolone delafloxacin; use of these drugs is limited by cost, clinical experience, and adverse drug effects. They should be reserved for patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate other agents. ",Infectious Diseases,,,

2018-08-18 00:00:00,What is the ideal voided sample? ,"The ideal voided urine sample for evaluation of UTI is one that accurately represents the bladder bacterial count with minimized contamination by bacteria colonizing the distal urethra and genital mucosa. In theory, this would be a clean-catch, midstream sample of the first micturition of the day.

However, clinical studies do not demonstrate that cleaning the meatus is associated with lower rates of contamination. Thus, for patients in whom the cleaning step may be impractical or difficult, a midstream urine collected (with the labia spread, for women) is likely an appropriate sample.",Infectious Diseases,,,
2018-08-18 00:00:00,What are the values for using Dipsticks for the diagnosis of UTI? ,"Dipsticks, which detect the presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrite in the urine, can be used as a screening tool and are generally performed whenever UTI is suspected. 
A positive dipstick can support the diagnosis of UTI in a patient with suggestive symptoms, and a negative test can refute the diagnosis if clinical suspicion is low. However, a negative nitrite and leukocyte esterase on the dipstick may represent false negative results in a truly infected patient, and a urine culture should generally be performed if clinical suspicion is high. 
",Infectious Diseases,,,
2018-08-18 00:00:00,What are the causes of false negative nitrite in urine? ,"Reasons for a negative nitrite test despite the presence of bladder bacteriuria include insufficient bladder incubation time for conversion of nitrate to nitrite, low urinary excretion of nitrate, inability of some organisms to convert nitrate to nitrite (such as Enterococcus faecalis), and decreased urine pH (due to cranberry juice or other dietary supplements).",Infectious Diseases,,,
2018-08-18 00:00:00,What are the causes of sterile pyuria? ,"Whereas true infection without pyuria is unusual, pyuria can occur in the absence of apparent bacterial infection, particularly in patients who have already taken antimicrobials (often due to self-medication). Other causes of sterile pyuria include:
1. Contamination of the urine sample by the sterilizing solution used to clean the meatus
2. Contamination of the urine sample with vaginal leukocytes from vaginal secretions
3. Chronic interstitial nephritis

2018-08-22 00:00:00,What are the causes of excess intestinal gas?,"When excessive intestinal gas does occur, it may be due to excessive air swallowing, increased intraluminal production from malabsorbed nutrients, decreased gas absorption due to obstruction, or expansion of intraluminal gas due to changes in atmospheric pressure. IBS, motility disorders and infections are also among the differential diagnosis. ",Gastroenterology,,,
2018-08-22 00:00:00,What is the composition of intestinal gas? ,"Nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), and methane (CH4) account for more that 99 percent of expelled intestinal gas. The composition of gas may vary in a given compartment of the gastrointestinal tract. As an example, stomach gas contains high concentrations of N2 and O2 similar to the atmosphere, while flatus contains less O2 and more CH4.",Gastroenterology,,,

2018-08-22 00:00:00,What are the factors that may account for a patient's awareness of bothersome flatus?,"A number of factors may account for a patient's awareness of bothersome flatus:
1. An alteration of intestinal motility or bacteria.
2. Dietary factors, such as an increased intake of lactose, fructose, sorbitol; undigestible starches in fruits, vegetables, and legumes; and carbonated beverages. 
3. Psychological factors that may create a heightened sensitivity to normal flatal passage.",Gastroenterology,,,
2018-08-22 00:00:00,What are the indications for investigating a new-onset flatulence?,"New onset flatulence associated with symptoms such as weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and distention or anorexia usually deserves a work-up for malabsorption. This may include stool examination for fat and Giardia, a lactose tolerance test, celiac serology, and a small bowel radiograph or upper endoscopy. For the patient with no ""alarm"" signals, such studies rarely uncover a specific underlying problem.",Gastroenterology,,,
2018-08-22 00:00:00,What is the treatment of flatulence? ,"Several measures can be undertaken to reduce annoying flatus.
1. Dietary measures including the avoidance of foods that may contribute to the problem is an obvious initial step. 
2. Simethicone, which causes gas bubbles to break and coalesce, is widely used for treating gaseous complaints. However, it has not been shown to be of benefit.
3. Beano, an alpha-galactosidase preparation, is often tried by patients on their own. This over-the-counter agent reduced gas production and frequency in subjects challenged with baked beans.
4. If bacterial overgrowth or an altered flora is strongly suspected, a two-week trial of antibiotic treatment may be helpful. 
5. Bismuth subsalicylate reduces the odor arising from hydrogen sulfide as well as other pungent components of flatus.
6. A variety of external devices to deodorize flatus (such as charcoal-lined cushions) are commercially available. ",Gastroenterology,,,
2018-08-22 00:00:00,What is the cause of the odor of flatus?,"None of the principal gases has an odor. Minor constituents of flatus, to which odor may be attributable, include sulfur-containing compounds as well as short-chain fatty acids, volatile amines, and ammonia.",Gastroenterology,,,

2018-08-22 00:00:00,What is the treatment of chronic eructation?,"Patients should be advised to discontinue habits as gum chewing, smoking, drinking carbonated beverages, and gulping food and liquids. 
Specific treatment of anxiety should be considered if this is a prominent symptom. Reassurance that isolated belching is a benign condition may help relieve underlying anxiety. Baclofen treatment (10 mg three times daily) has been reported to reduce supragastric belching and aerophagia, and can be tried when behavioral approaches are unsuccessful ",Gastroenterology,,,
2018-08-22 00:00:00,What are the foods that should be stopped in patients with flatulence? ,"If patients who complain predominantly of flatus, dietary changes are suggested. These include a temporary trial of lactose and fructose avoidance, avoidance of sorbitol (which may be contained in diet foods and chewing gum), avoidance of ingestion of foods known to promote gaseousness (such as cabbage, onions, broccoli, brussel sprouts, wheat, and potatoes), and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP).",Gastroenterology,,,

2018-09-18 00:00:00,What are the conditioning regimens for HCT?,"Conditioning regimens (also called preparative regimens) for HCT can be myeloablative, nonmyeloablative, or reduced-intensity. These are defined as follows:
-Myeloablative regimens are those that destroy the recipient's bone marrow, causing aplasia and pancytopenia that is usually long-lasting and irreversible. Infusion of HSCs is required to reconstitute hematopoiesis.
-Nonmyeloablative regimens do not destroy the recipient's bone marrow or cause significant cytopenias; however, engrafting donor T cells usually eliminate host hematopoietic cells.
-Reduced-intensity regimens are intermediate between myeloablative and nonmyeloablative. These regimens cause cytopenias and suppress the host's immune system to allow engraftment.",Stem Cells,,,
2018-09-18 00:00:00,What are the types of hematopoietic cell transplant? ,"Allogeneic and autologus 
Allogeneic HCT refers to HCT using hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a donor. The donor may be related (eg, sibling) or unrelated. Related donors can be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched (typically, matched at eight of eight HLA loci) or haploidentical (matched at half of their HLA loci). Autologous HCT refers to HCT using the patient's own HSCs. This is not useful for individuals with SCD unless the autologous cells have been modified (eg, by gene therapy, which is experimental).",Stem Cells,,,

2018-09-18 00:00:00,Who are the optimal donors for HCT in SCD patients?,"Siblings (or other HLA-matched first-degree relatives such as parents or children) are always preferable as HCT donors for individuals with SCD. These donors are associated with the greatest survival, lowest rates of graft failure/rejection, and reduced transplant morbidities, especially lower risks of GVHD. Siblings without SCD and siblings with sickle cell trait are both acceptable as donors; inclusion of siblings with sickle cell trait as potential donors expands the donor pool to approximately three-quarters of the patient's HLA-matched siblings, although the proportion of individuals with suitable donors remains small.",Stem Cells,,,
2018-09-18 00:00:00,What are the effects of age and parity on donor selections for HCT? ,"While retrospective analyses have suggested that specific donor characteristics, such as age, sex, and parity, may impact the incidence of transplant-related complications, these factors are only relevant when there are multiple donors. When available, preference is given to younger donors and to male or nulliparous female donors.",Stem Cells,,,
2018-09-18 00:00:00,What is the effect of CMV status on donor selection for HCT? ,"CMV status may impact donor selection when there are more than one otherwise equal donor options. CMV-seropositive recipients have worse survival than seronegative recipients as a group. The best outcomes are seen in CMV-negative recipients with a CMV-negative donor. If the recipient is CMV seronegative, a CMV-seronegative donor is preferred since this will greatly reduce the risk of subsequent infection with CMV, assuming that the patient receives CMV-seronegative blood products. If the recipient is CMV seropositive, some centers advocate for the use of a CMV-seropositive donor with the hope that this will result in a faster restoration of CMV immunity.",Stem Cells,,,

Serum sickness-like reactions (SSLRs) present as rash, arthritis, and fever beginning several days to weeks following administration of a drug.",Immunology,,,
2018-10-15 00:00:00,How long  does it take for serum sickness to develop? ,"The most common symptoms of serum sickness are rash, fever, malaise, and polyarthralgias or polyarthritis, which occur one to two weeks after first exposure to the responsible agent and resolve within a few weeks of discontinuing the drug. In patients who have been previously exposed to the agent, the syndrome starts earlier (ie, within one to seven days of receiving the inciting agent), and the illness has a more severe and ""explosive"" onset.",Immunology,,,
2018-10-15 00:00:00,What is the management of serum sickness? ,"The management of these reactions primarily involves discontinuation of possible culprit agents. Typically, fever and arthralgias resolve and new skin lesions stop forming within 48 hours of this intervention. This is often all that is required for patients with mild symptoms. 
Further treatments depend upon the discomfort of the individual patient. Antihistamines may be administered for symptomatic relief of pruritus. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and analgesics may be given for symptomatic treatment of low-grade fever and arthralgias. 
For patients with higher fever (eg, temperature >38.5°C [>101.3°F]), more severe arthritis and arthralgias, or extensive rashes, short courses of glucocorticoids are suggested. ",Immunology,,,

2018-10-15 00:00:00,What is the effect of previous BCG vaccination on tuberculin skin testing? ,"Most individuals who have received BCG vaccine have a tuberculin reaction of 3 to 19 mm in size at two to three months following vaccination. The reaction wanes with time; at more than 10 years after vaccination, it is generally <10 mm. 
Therefore, previous BCG vaccination should NOT influence decisions regarding interpretation of TST results in individuals vaccinated at birth more than 10 years earlier. This is especially important since most individuals who receive BCG vaccine come from countries where the incidence of TB is high. However, since interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are not affected by BCG administration, if this test is available it can be used to interpret positive TSTs in persons with a history of BCG immunization.

Fibrocystic disease may fluctuate in size with the menstrual cycle, but breast cancer progressively increases in size regardless of the menstrual cycle. Like fibrocystic changes, fibroadenomas tend to worsen during periods of elevated oestrogen levels (such as pregnancy) and decline in size during menopause.
2. Unlike breast cancer, fibrocystic changes are typically symmetrical and are associated with cyclical breast pain, which worsens in the luteal phase of menses.
3. Unlike the incidence of breast cancer, which increases with age, fibrocystic disease usually resolves at menopause.
4. Palpation of a fibroadenoma reveals a smooth, well-demarcated and mobile mass.

2018-11-11 00:00:00,What are the recommendation for breast cancer screening? ,"Mammography screening every 2 years has revealed the largest effect on breast cancer mortality reduction in women aged 50 to 69 years; therefore, the European Union supports mammography screening in this age group. However, it is unclear whether this same effect is observed in women aged 40 to 49 years.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends biennial mammographic screening for women 50 to 74 years of age.  Women aged 40 to 49 years can be considered for mammogram based on familial history as well as patient preference as the task force has determined that the benefits of screening slightly outweigh the harms. There remains inadequate evidence to recommend for or against screening mammography in women aged 75 and older.

The Swiss Medical Board concluded that the benefits of screening do not clearly outweigh the harms. Thus, the panel recommends that no new systematic mammography screening programs be introduced.",Oncology,Breast Cancer,,
2018-11-11 00:00:00,What is the role of clinical exam in screening for breast cancer? ,"The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program in the US found that adding clinical breast examination to mammography led to an increase in the cancer detection rate, such that 5% of cancers were detected by clinical breast examination alone initially (the screening mammogram had been negative, benign, or probably benign).
